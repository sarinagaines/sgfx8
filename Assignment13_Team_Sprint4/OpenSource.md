**Reflection on the articles about why one would participate in open source software.**

I learned that there are many reasons for participating in open source software. For starters, 
it is an effective way to collaborate with other companies on projects of mutual interest. Businesses 
are benefited by working on open source as well because they can influence direction. Some companies such 
as Intel, and Samsung, have open source programs focused on contributing to open source communities. This 
is because companies use open source code to build their own products and see strategic value contributing 
back to those projects.  Money is another motivator because companies pay contributors to work on open source.
There is also career motivation, there is some evidence that open source software is different from proprietary
software development. Additionally, there is the desire to assistance and be present in the programmer community.
Some people also just have fun and enjoy working on open software projects. From reading these articles,
I have learned that open source projects are beneficial to everyone involved. I also learned how contributions work, 
this is something I hadnâ€™t been aware of prior to reading the articles provided by Professor Goggins. 
There are varying contribution processes, some include guidelines with information on coding style, 
language, formatting etc. Some require signed contributor agreements and even patches to be posted to 
the mailing list. I now have a better understanding of open source software projects, how contributing works and why 
people choose to contribute.
