**1) A description of which projects you looked at.**
I looked at the two projects provided on the the Assignment 13 GitHub page.
I reviewed these to get an idea of what an open source project looks like, how information is provided 
and what the different tutorials, examples and README.md files look like for an open source project. 
I then went to google and looked at various SSO open source projects, I chose to include key cloak because 
I like how they provided information on their webpage. I looked at JOSSO as well, JOSSO is an identity 
and access management solution focused on visual modeling and a generative approach. Keycloack allows
you to add authentication and secure services to applications without storing users or authenticating them.

**2) Why you chose the one you did?**
However, I am choosing Sailsjs, which was provided by Professor Goggins.
I am choosing this one because I like how they provided information the best
and find the steps a little simpler to follow.

**3) How far you got in making it work?**
I followed all instructions provided by Sailsjs from https://sailsjs.com/get-started.
These instructions included installing Sails, making sure I had Noje.js installed and creating my app.
I was successful in completing all the steps and got my SSO page set up.
I did not make many design changes to the page, I added in "Hello World" as well as my name and what class the page was for. 
More changes can definelty be made to make the page appear nicer. 

**4) What obstacles you encountered in the process?**
I didn’t encounter to many obstacles, the instructions provided by Sailsjs were very clear.
My only obstacle was figuring out how to upload all the folder to my GitHub repository because you I didn't realize you can't upload a folder through the GitHub website. I had to do so by cloning my repository and then pushing my changes. Also, I had trouble figuring out how to edit the webpage so that it may look how I’d like it to. I figured out how to do so by editing the Welcome page's HTML code in GitHub.
