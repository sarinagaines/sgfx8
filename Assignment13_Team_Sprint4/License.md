**Identify one or more open source software licenses you would prefer to use for an open source project you create, and why.**

I would prefer to use the Apache License 2.0. I am familiar with this company and this license is listed as being a license
that complies with the Open Source definition. This license allows software to be freely used, modified and shared. 
I believe that because the Apache License 2.0 is on this list, it has been approved by the Open Source Initiative
and has gone through the Open Source Initiative’s license review process. The fact that this license has gone
though these steps shows that is common and trusted by others and is not a “fake” open source license. 
A full document containing the terms and condone for use, reproduction and distribution is provided so 
that users understand exactly what the Apache License is doing for the User.
