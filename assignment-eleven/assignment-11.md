I plan to attend the April 8th 9:00am Evolution Working Group zoom call and will fork the Evolution Working Group Repository. 

Reflection on the CHAOSS Community Podcast: 

I learned that the CHAOSS project is meant to explore community health and what community health means. 
The CHAOSS project originated from this interest in community health, this topic was submitted with the idea 
that not many people would be interested but then many people showed up for the meeting which expressed this
wide interest in community health.  The podcast explained to me how CHAOSS came about and how the group members
came to be part of the project. I also learned that purpose of the podcast is to help others learn and obtain 
a bigger perspective on how to make community health transparent and actionable. I have never really thought
about metrics or open source software so hearing people talk how they came to understand the importance of metrics 
and open source software opened my eyes.  Ms. Dawn mentioned at the beginning of the podcast that it is important 
to gather data for data sake but being able to tie that data back to business goal and what the business is doing
is why metrics are especially important. With metrics we can understand what engagement looks like and we are 
able to better understand this engagement.
