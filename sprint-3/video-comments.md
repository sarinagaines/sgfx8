Video Comments

In the video, the group began by discussing waiting a month to implement the change because the change gets rid of two metrics.  Then new metrcis were disuccsed. These new metrics included inactive contributors, code length and forks turned. The inactive contributors regards how many contributors have gone inactive over a specified period of time.  Group members discussed how formatting for one of the files wasnâ€™t consistent and needed to be adjusted. The general Chaoss metric template was discussed as well. The team went through the metrics looking for redundancy and spelling errors and looked to make sense of what the metric was proposing. The team then went on to discuss the code length method. The metrics are reviewed so that an updated version can be sent again.
