**Submission of the final iteration of my project.**<br />

In this iteration, I updated the links to book reviews, added in an about my introduction and adjusted the apperances of the page. I attempted to create a local JSON file to read in but was not successfull. I attempted adding images in but was not successful with that either. I visted many sites to try and figure out how both these things could be done but despite my work, I was not able to complete what I wanted too. I am satisfied with what I currently have, the app does what I intended it to. However, with more time and help I belive I can make it even better. <br /><br />

**I've had an issue where the Client ID and Client Secret is no longer set and I have to reset them to get the app to work once more.**<br />

If you run into the issue,<br />
My Client ID is: 937756459082-lfmtp4cihoeqnp17cmg9d0uvmamcud1t.apps.googleusercontent.com<br />
My Client Secret is: LRFHxKE-y8wCvsKYdmsU7i_q<br />

To run it you will:<br />
1)Clone my repository<br />
2)Navigate to the 'my-google' folder within my repository<br />
3)Enter 'python app.py'<br />
4)Go to Chrome and enter "https://127.0.0.1:5000/" into the web address bar.<br />
5)Login<br />

if you come across the error "OAuth Client not found", you will need to set the client ID and client secret in terminal then repeat the above steps to access the app.<br /><br />

**From my first iteration:**<br />
I attempted to display data using an API but I have no experience using APIs and have never called a restful API before. I ran into a lot of issues getting my app to run. I visited the following sites to help me:<br /> https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-weather-app-using-openweathermap-and-flask-ed7402239d83 <br />https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-weather-app-using-flask-python/ <br /> https://realpython.com/flask-google-login/#creating-your-own-web-application <br />https://openweathermap.org/api <br />https://www.codeastar.com/flask-easy-web-app-python/ <br />https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/building-app <br />https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36781105/import-urllib-request-importerror-no-module-named-request <br />https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41487473/nameerror-name-request-is-not-defined <br />https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/comments/12798 <br />https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29457624/nameerror-name-flask-is-not-defined<br /> https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/ <br />https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1250103/attributeerror-module-object-has-no-attribute
<br /><br />
I worked with the geeksforgeeks weather api example for a while and ran into numerous issues. I continued to debug and referenced forums for help but after a while, I still could not get the application to run. I decided to go with another idea, a book blog, and it is one I prefer and have experience in. My idea currently isn't using a hardcoded local JSON file to pull data from but I will work on implementing that.

I visted all the sites listed above and more to attempt and load a local JSON file and images but was not successful.
