Submission of the commit of my first iteration from my github repository under the assignment.

In this iteration, I added a list of books I reccommend, links to my book reviews which currently have a place holder link to websites regarding the book and an reccommendation email form. I've adjust some minor appearance features. 

I've had an issue where the Client ID and Client Secret is no longer set and I have to reset them to get the app to work once more. 

If you run into the issue, <br /> 
My Client ID is: 937756459082-lfmtp4cihoeqnp17cmg9d0uvmamcud1t.apps.googleusercontent.com <br /> 
My Client Secret is: LRFHxKE-y8wCvsKYdmsU7i_q <br /> 
<br /> 
**To run it you will:** <br /> 
1)Clone my repository  <br /> 
2)Navigate to the 'my-google' folder within my repository <br /> 
3)Enter 'python app.py' <br /> 
4)Go to Chrome and enter "https://127.0.0.1:5000/" into the web address bar. <br /> 
5)Login <br /> 
- if you come across the error "OAuth Client not found", you will need to set the client ID and client secret in terminal then 
repeat the above steps to access the app.  <br />
