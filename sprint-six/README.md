Submission of the commit of my first iteration from my github repository under the assignment.

In this iteration, I added a list of books I reccommend, links to my book reviews which currently have a place holder link to websites regarding the book and an reccommendation email form. I've adjust some minor appearance features. 

I've had an issue where the Client ID and Client Secret is no longer set and I have to reset them to get the app to work once more. 

If you run into the issue, <br /> 
My Client ID is: 937756459082-lfmtp4cihoeqnp17cmg9d0uvmamcud1t.apps.googleusercontent.com <br /> 
My Client Secret is: LRFHxKE-y8wCvsKYdmsU7i_q <br /> 
<br /> 
**To run it you will:** <br /> 
1)Clone my repository  <br /> 
2)Navigate to the 'my-google' folder within my repository <br /> 
3)Enter 'python app.py' <br /> 
4)Go to Chrome and enter "https://127.0.0.1:5000/" into the web address bar. <br /> 
5)Login <br /> 
- if you come across the error "OAuth Client not found", you will need to set the client ID and client secret in terminal then 
repeat the above steps to access the app.  <br /> 

I attempted to display data using an api but I have no experience using apis and ran into a lot of issues getting my app to run. I visited the following sites to help me:

I worked with the geeksforgeeks weather api example for a while and ran into numerous issues. I continued to debug and referenced forums for help but after a while, I still could not get the application to run. I decided to go with another idea, a book blog, and it is one I prefer and have experience in. My idea currently isn't using a hardcoded JSON file to pull data from but I will work on implementing that.
