Everything seemed to work as it should for me. The vimeo videos provided great guidance and helped me to understand what needed to be done. I like the Flask Google login implementation the most, it is something I see implemented with various websites and applications I use daily. I hope to have my app may be visually appealing. I hope to implement my own website that can be accessed using Google Login.
