**SSO is a difficult set of concepts to grasp. Describe what worked, and what did not. Provide a list of sites you visited in your quest to understand and get your app going. If your app did not work (for SSO to Google OAUTH or other provider you selected), explain where you got stuck. Finally, briefly describe what you hope to have functioning with SSO, in terms of “your app”, by the end of the semester.**

Everything seemed to work as it should for me. The vimeo videos provided great guidance and helped me to understand what needed to be done. However, I came across one issue. After setting the CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET and seeing that my app, the app later doesn't work and give the error, "OAuth Client not found". I then need to reset the CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECERET in terminal. I figured out how to add stuff to the app.py file to increase what is displayed on the webpage.I figured out how to adjust the website appearance but only inline CSS seems to work.<br />

I like the Flask Google login implementation the most, it is something I see implemented with various websites and applications I use daily. I hope to have my app may be visually appealing. I hope to implement my own website that can be accessed using Google Login. I plan to have data of my choice displayed by the end of the semester.
