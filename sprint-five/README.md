I chose to follow along with the videos posted by Professor Goggins. I completed the Dex example as well as the example of google authentication. 

My google authentication app works. However, I've had an issue where the Client ID and Client Secret is no longer set and I have to reset them to get the app to work once more. 

If you run into the issue, <br /> 
My Client ID is: 937756459082-lfmtp4cihoeqnp17cmg9d0uvmamcud1t.apps.googleusercontent.com <br /> 
My Client Secret is: LRFHxKE-y8wCvsKYdmsU7i_q <br /> 
<br /> 
**To run it you will: ** <br /> 
1)Clone my repository  <br /> 
2)Navigate to the 'my-google' folder within my repository <br /> 
3)Enter 'python app.py' <br /> 
4)Go to Chrome and enter "https://127.0.0.1:5000/" into the web address bar. <br /> 
5)Login <br /> 
- if you come across the error "OAuth Client not found", you will need to set the client ID and client secret in terminal then 
repeat the above steps to access the app.  <br />
