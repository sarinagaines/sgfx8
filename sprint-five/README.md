I chose to follow along with the videos posted by Professor Goggins. I completed the Dex example as well as the example of google authentication. 

My google authentication app works. However, I've had an issue where the Client ID and Client Secret is no longer set and I have to reset them to get the app to work once more. 

If you run into the issue,
My Client ID is: 937756459082-lfmtp4cihoeqnp17cmg9d0uvmamcud1t.apps.googleusercontent.com
My Client Secret is: LRFHxKE-y8wCvsKYdmsU7i_q
